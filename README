This is a small (educational) game to demonstrate how the autocorrelation 
plot and periodogram change with different parameters in a time series.
It was created after the ECDC-EpiConcept Time Series Analysis course at 
Veyrier-du-Lac on 12-14 September 2016.
Comments and suggestions are most welcome!

You have to have R and shiny installed (or just RStudio). 
Place app.R in your working directory and run it with:

library(shiny)
runApp('.')

Enjoy,
